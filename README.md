### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

This is where I keep code for presentations I might give at a meetup or conference.

Other things are mini personal projects or random halfbakery. View at your own risk!

My professional work is done for companies who don't open source their code.

I did create a blog post at one employer and they never used it, so I put it [here](https://ddanger.github.io/Talking-Code).
